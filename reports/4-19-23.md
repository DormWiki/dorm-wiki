# Team Report
This is the team report for the week of 4/12-4/19.
## Plan From Last Week
None; this is the first report.
## Progress On Goals
This week we have started working on sketching out a schedule, planning milestons and setting up issues on GitHub. We have set up all the milestones, as well as the general issues leading up to the next milestone. We will most likely add more issues as we reach our next milestone. We also have finished the sketches of the front-end sites and began working on a mockup. 
## Plan For Next Week
For next week, we plan to finish the mockup and start working towards our alpha release. This means starting to work on functionality, setting up enviornments, finish working on the "skeleton" of the project and design of back-end.
