# Team Report
This is the team report for the week of 4/12-4/19.
## Plan From Last Week
None; this is the first report.
## Progress on Goals
This week, we focused on sketching out a schedule, planning milestones and setting up issues (tasks/to-do's) in our GitHub repo. So far, we have set up all the milestones as well as the general issues leading up to the next milestone. We will most likely be adding more issues as we approach our next milestone. We also have finished the sketches of the website pages and have begun working on a mockup. 
## Plan for Next Week
For next week, we plan to finish the mockup and start working towards our alpha release. This means starting to work on functionality, setting up environments, and finishing the "skeleton" of the project and design of back-end.
