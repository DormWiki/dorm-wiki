# Team Report
## Plan From Last Week
Integrate front-end with backend. For frontend, enhance pages with more features/functionality. 
For backend, continuing on implementing authentication and the search engine.

## Progress On Goals
We have successfully integrated the front-end with the backend. The front-end team has improved the 
design and layout of the pages and has added styling for some of the new features (e.g. submitting
an event, submitting a review). The back-end has added more api calls.

## Plan For Next Week
For the front-end, cleaning and polishing up the website -- adding images, adding more pages, etc.
For the back-end, focusing on authenticating through Google and the search engine on the main page.
