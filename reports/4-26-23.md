# Team Report
This is the team report for the week of 4/19-4/26.
## Plan From Last Week
For next week, we plan to finish the mockup and start working towards our alpha release. This means starting to work on functionality, setting up environments, and finishing the "skeleton" of the project and design of back-end.
## Progress on Goals
We are almost done with the mockup. We finished designing the back-end and set up the repo successfuly for us to begin implementation. 
## Plan for Next Week
Finish out front end design with skeleton functions. For backend, implement authentication, have a basic database table setup, and begin working on search implementation.
