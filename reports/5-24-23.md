# Team Report
## Plan From Last Week
For the front-end, cleaning and polishing up the website -- adding images, adding more pages, etc.
For the back-end, focusing on authenticating through Google and the search engine on the main page.

## Progress On Goals
We polished the website to look modern by adding images and changed design for the components. The individual event pages are finished, and the dorm pages include detailed reviews.

For backend, Google authentication and session persistant are close to being finished. Each table now includes more detailed properties.

## Plan For Next Week

Finish polishing the website, mostly ensure css works properly for different viewports.

For database, begin some cleanup routine to ensure all the data is valid.
